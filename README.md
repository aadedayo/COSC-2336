# COSC-2336
DATA STRUCTURES - Topics include recursion, the underlying philosophy of object-oriented
programming, fundamental data structures (including stacks, queues,
linked lists, hash tables, trees, and graphs), the basics of algorithmic
analysis, and an introduction to the principles of language translation. 

These are some of the java programs i wrote in this class.

I have either normal comments or Javadoc in most of them, in order to explain how i wrote the program.


  # Project Name - Recursion
  The purpose of this program is to practise recursion by implementing recursive methods to solve problems.
  
  * File Name - gcdCalculation.java
  
  This class creates a recursive method to calculate (Greatest Common Divisor) GCD of two numbers, and a main method test it.
  * File Name - palindrome.java
  
  This class creates a recursive methood that checks if the given string is palindrome or not, and a main method test it.
